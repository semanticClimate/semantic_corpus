    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The risks of climate change for human health are becoming increasingly apparent. The prevention indicator system of the German federal states (L\u00e4nder in Deutschland), developed between 2018 and 2022, was therefore reviewed in relation to its relevance to climate change.<h4>Methods</h4>As a first step, a working group with members from different German federal states developed a model on the relationships between climate change and health in the context of prevention. Central aspects of this model were translated into a checklist based on guiding questions, which was used to conduct a systematic, standardised, and evidence-informed assessment of the climate relevance of the prevention indicator system of the German federal states.<h4>Results</h4>Climate change relevance was identified for a total of 49 out of 73 prevention indicators. Most frequently, climate relevance was found for indicators relating to particularly vulnerable groups to climate change-related health impacts (27 indicators), followed by 18 indicators addressing health consequences of climate change.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The assessment methodology that we developed proved suitable and can be applied to assess climate relevance in other health indicator systems. This prevention indicator system requires further development of climate aspects that have not yet been included, such as 'health-relevant climate change impacts', 'health costs', and indicators on vaccine-preventable diseases as climate adaptation measures.",
